# Winning numbers (matches)

- 1 match = 1 point
- every point after that doubles the current points
- 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64 -> 128

- you have 8 numbers, they are on the right
- there are 5 winning numbers, they are on the right

### example 1

- 4/8 of your numbers match winning numbers
- = you win 8 points (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8)
